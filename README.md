This project repo is only for demonstration of side-work projects, training producibles and personal hobby-runs, for anyone that could be interested in watching, sharing or validating skills. It does not contain professional company-related software or protected under license content even if it is made by me personally. Everything is free, open-source and made for educational purposes only.
